# Create a function named sillycase that takes a string and returns that string 
# with the first half lowercased and the last half uppercased.

# The first half of the string, rounded with round(), should be lowercased.
# The second half should be uppercased.
# E.g. "Treehouse" should come back as "treeHOUSE"

    return strings[:round(len(strings) / 2.0)].lower() + strings[round(len(strings) / 2.0):].upper()
